        <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs,
            hard cheese, cured pork and black pepper. The dish arrived
            at it's modern form, with its current name, in the middle
            of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano,
            or a combinatio of the two. Spaghetti is the most common
            pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, liguine, or bucatini are
            also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the
            meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common
            substitute outside of italy
